Brief Description
=================
This was our first try to make a multi protocol (from transport layer to application layer) VPN suite for tunneling purposes, but, mainly: it was for learning.

Current Status
==============

No authentication at all, very very insecure (overflows, ...), just for learning and testing purporses.
Only tunnels using TCP connection.

Usage
=====
./configure
make

Planning
========
Nothing is planned, but some ideas are being slowwwly coogked, hope in some time new commits appears :D)
